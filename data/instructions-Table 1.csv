Overview,"This is a a scouting database which calculates component calculated contributions (OPRs) and other metrics using the data from the TBA API. Each sheet currently contains data from a distinct FRC event. A new database will be published weekly within a day or two of all of that week's events being completed. For sheets which contain events that have not yet occurred, seed values for each category are available in order to aid in pre-scouting. ",,,

FAQ,,,,
Question,Answer,,,
"Is ""Calculated Contribution to total points"" the same thing as OPR",Yes. ,,,
Where can I find more detail on the WM Elo metric?,You can find more information on this in my FRC Elo 2008-2016 document. ,,,
Why do some of the gear contribution categories and defense categories all have -1 for their value?,"These are metrics that I believe will be valuable, but thatI still have to determine precisely the best way to calculate. ",,,
Why does everything look so similar to the 2834 scouting database?,"I modeled this workbook off of the 2834 and 1114 scouting databases because I like the format, and because it allows people to relatively easily switch between the two. ",,,
Why are the anterior Touchpad Activation Rate values for Hatboro-Horsham and Gainesville -1?,"TBA is missing data for these events, so I am not calculating this metric for these events. ",,,

"What follows are brief descriptions of each category listed in the event sheets and in ""world results."" ",,,,
Category,Description,,,
team Number,The FRC team number,,,
nickname,The given team's nickname,,,
home Championship,"The given team's home championship based on their location. Note that some teams will attend a championship that is not their home championship. To see teams registered for each championship, see the ChampionshipHouston and ChampionshipSt.Louis sheets. ",,,
event,The event at which all of the metrics were obtained. ,,,
seed Strength (future events only),"This can have any of 4 values, which represent how good the estimate for their performance is. A value of 3 is given to teams that have already competed in 2017. The seed values for each category come from the team's contributions at their most recent event. A value of 2 is given to veteran teams that have not yet competed in 2017. The seed values are obtained by taking the team's calculated contribution to total points value from 2016 and normalizing it to each category, and then reverting 10% to the mean value of that category. A value of 1  is given to rookie or new veteran teams that have not yet competed in 2017. The seed values for each category come from the average of all rookie contributions from week 1 competitions. A value of 0 is given to all teams in the week 0 scouting database. The seed values for each category come from the average of scores from the official week 0 competition. ",,,

auto Rotor Points,The number of autonomous points for engaging rotors the given team contributes. ,,,
auto Scored Gears,"The number of gears scored in autonomous the given team contributes (3 gears when 2 auto rotors are engaged, 1 gear when 1 auto rotor is engaged, 0 gears when no auto rotors are engaged). ",,,
estimated Auto Gears,More information soon. Unused for now. ,,,
estimated Auto Gears 2,More information soon. Unused for now. ,,,

rotor 1 Engaged,"The given team's contribution to engaging the first rotor (0 = does not contribute to engagement, 1 = engages the rotor without assistance)",,,
rotor 2 Engaged,"The given team's contribution to engaging the second rotor (0 = does not contribute to engagement, 1 = engages the rotor without assistance)",,,
rotor 3 Engaged,"The given team's contribution to engaging the third rotor (0 = does not contribute to engagement, 1 = engages the rotor without assistance)",,,
rotor 4 Engaged,"The given team's contribution to engaging the fourth rotor (0 = does not contribute to engagement, 1 = engages the rotor without assistance)",,,

touchpad Far,"The given team's contribution to activating the touchpad farthest from the scoring table (0 = does not contribute to activation, 1 = activates the touchpad without assistance)",,,
teleop Takeoff Points,The total number of takeoff points the given team contributes. ,,,
anterior Touchpad Activation Rate,"This value is not calculated in the same way as the other categories, it is not a calculated contribution. Instead, it is the number of times that the touchpad directly in front of the given team was activated divided by the total number of matches that team played. Considering that most teams opt to climb directly in front of their station, it can be interpreted as a climb rate. Unlike other categories, this does incorporate playoff matches. Also, it makes the assumption that the scoring table is on the same side as the feeder stations. I believe that this has been the case for all events through week 5, but since it will provide garbage results for events at which this is not the case, this should be used with caution. ",,,
